# EmployeeManagementWebApp
Internal employee management web app

This was going to be part of a bigger Portfolio project I was creating. unfortunately it became more of a sandbox project where I just started implementing things I learned about ASP.NET Core. I decided to take lessons learned from this project to create [This web app](https://github.com/MartinKAtGitHub/MyResume.WebApp).
